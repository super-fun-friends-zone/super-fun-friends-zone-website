      <p>Welcome to the <span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span>, a space where awesome friends get together to teach one another about their hobbies, professional interests, or that cool thing they read about last week. </p>
      <h3><span class="sffz">SFFZ</span> is a collaborative learning zone and we want YOU to participate!</h3>

    <h3>How do we choose talks?</h3>

    <p>SFFZ is committed to giving a platform for talks that might not otherwise happen. We prioritize marginalized voices, and
    kooky but interesting and well informed subject material. We DO NOT take previous speaking experience into account, and actively
    encourage first time speakers to apply.</p>

    <p>Our audience prefers talks that are engaging and have a sense of humor. This doesnâ€™t mean talks canâ€™t be about serious subject
    matter, but be aware that most of the talks at our events are lighthearted. All presentations are subject to our <a href="https://github.com/super-fun-friends-zone/super-fun-friends-zone.github.io/blob/master/event_code_of_conduct.md">Code of Conduct</a></p>

    <p>Donâ€™t want to present? Thatâ€™s fine, too! We encourage attendees to take notes, livetweet, and ask awesome questions of our
    speakers afterwards.</p>

    <p>
       Please note that SFFZ has a code of conduct for all events and online spaces. Make sure to check it out <a href="https://github.com/super-fun-friends-zone/super-fun-friends-zone.github.io/blob/master/event_code_of_conduct.md">on GitHub</a>.
