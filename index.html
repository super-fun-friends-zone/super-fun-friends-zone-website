    <div class="intro">
      <p>Welcome to the <span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span>, a space where awesome friends get together to teach one another about their hobbies, professional interests, or that cool thing they read about last week. </p>
      <h3><span class="sffz">SFFZ</span> is a collaborative learning zone and we want YOU to participate!</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>The first <span class="sffz">SFFZ Talk About Things Conference</span> will take place on November 5th, 2017 at <a href="https://www.evanstongames.com/">Evanston Games and Cafe</a> from 1-3pm. Please do our host a solid and buy a sandwich or some coffee while you’re there. <b>Be sure to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sffz-talk-about-things-conference-tickets-36909638723">RSVP on Eventbrite</a>!</b></p>
    <p>No need to buy a ticket, we just need to know how many chairs to put out and how much space we'll need. There's no cost to attend, but donations towards space rental are super appreciated on the day of the event. We can’t wait to see you!</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>This first event is a lightning talk showcase of cool things people are learning about or involved in. Talks are 5-15 minutes long and assume no prior knowledge of the topic. We've selected our talks for this first event, and we'll be announcing them soon!</p>
    <p>Don't want to present, and just want to attend and soak up all that awesome knowledge? That's fine, too! We encourage you to take notes, livetweet, and ask awesome questions of our speakers afterwards.</p>
    <p>Please note that <span>SFFZ</span> has a code of conduct for all events and online spaces. <b>Make sure to check it out <a href="https://github.com/super-fun-friends-zone/super-fun-friends-zone.github.io/blob/master/event_code_of_conduct.md">on github</a></b>.
