  <h1>Super Fun<br>Friends Zone</h1>
<h2>Cool Friends Who Teach Each Other Cool Stuff</h2>
<main>
  <div class="intro">
    <p>Welcome to the <span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span>, a space where awesome friends get together to teach one another about their hobbies, professional interests, or that cool thing they read about last week. </p>
    <h3><span class="sffz">SFFZ</span> is a collaborative learning zone and we want YOU to participate!</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <p>Our first event will be a lightning talk showcase of cool things people are learning about or involved in. Talks should last about 10 minutes, and can be about anything you find interesting. Talks should assume that your audience has no prior knowledge of your topic, but should still aim to be engaging for people familiar with your material.</p>
  <p>If you’re not sure what to talk about, here are some categories that we think sound fascinating:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gaming and interactive storytelling media</li>
    <li>Science and technology</li>
    <li>Making and crafting</li>
    <li>Art, music, and culture</li>
    <li>Anything else you find interesting!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Slide decks for talks are encouraged but not required. We will provide projectors for speakers and make slides and presenter notes available online after the event.</p>
  <p>We will open up a proposal form soon where you can submit your idea. If you’d like to receive updates on proposal deadlines and upcoming events, you should sign up for our newsletter.</p>

  <p>The first <span class="sffz">SFFZ Talk About Things Conference</span> will take place on November 5th, 2017 at <a href="evanstongames.com">Evanston Games and Cafe</a> from 1-3pm. Please do our host a solid and buy a sandwich or some coffee while you’re there. No need to buy a ticket, but donations towards space rental are super appreciated on the day of the event. We can’t wait to see you!</p>
