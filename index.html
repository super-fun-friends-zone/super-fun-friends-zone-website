      <p>Welcome to the <span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span>, a space where awesome friends get together to teach one another about their hobbies, professional interests, or that cool thing they read about last week. </p>
      <h3><span class="sffz">SFFZ</span> is a collaborative learning zone and we want YOU to participate!</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>Our first event will be a lightning talk showcase of cool things people are learning about or involved in. Talks should last about 10 minutes, and can be about anything you find interesting. Talks should assume that your audience has no prior knowledge of your topic, but should still aim to be engaging for people familiar with your material.</p>
    <p>Don't want to present, and just want to attend and soak up all that awesome knowledge? That's fine, too! We encourage you to take notes, livetweet, and ask awesome questions of our speakers afterwards.</p>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>The first <span class="sffz">SFFZ Talk About Things Conference</span> will take place on November 5th, 2017 at <a href="evanstongames.com">Evanston Games and Cafe</a> from 1-3pm. Please do our host a solid and buy a sandwich or some coffee while you’re there. <b>Be sure to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sffz-talk-about-things-conference-tickets-36909638723">RSVP on Eventbrite</a>!</b></p>
    <p>No need to buy a ticket, we just need to know how many chairs to put out and how much space we'll need. There's no cost to attend, but donations towards space rental are super appreciated on the day of the event. We can’t wait to see you!</p>

      <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>Because we're cool friends who take care of one another</p>
      <p><span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span> is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, online conversation, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any <span class="sffz">Super Fun Friends Zone</span> event, or expulsion from mailing lists, Facebook groups and other community spaces to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please ask for help from a Facebook page admin, website admin, or event organizer.</p>
