# Super Fun Friends Zone Event and Community Code of Conduct

## Because we're cool friends who take care of one another

**Super Fun Friends Zone** is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, online conversation, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any **Super Fun Friends Zone** event, or expulsion from mailing lists, Facebook groups and other community spaces to resolve the issue.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please ask for help from a Facebook page admin, website admin, or event organizer.
